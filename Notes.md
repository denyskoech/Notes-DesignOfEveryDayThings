<h1>User Centered Design</h1> 
<p><i>Off the Leash by W.B.Park</i></p>

<p>The point of POET is all about the user. It emphasizes on making products useable and understandable. </p>
<p>A design should:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make easy to determine what actions are possible at any moment.</li>
    <li>Make things visible.</li>
    <li>Make it easy to evaluate the current state of the system.</li>
    <li>Follow natural mappings; between intentions and the required actions; between actions and the resulting effects; and between the information that is visible and the interpretation of the system state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that user can figure out what to do and can tell what is going on.</p>
<p>Design should make use of the natural properties of people and the world e.g. it should exploit natural relationships and natural constraints. Design should make it as much as possible to do without instruction or labels and if need be of training and instruction, then it should be needed once. If everything is in place then then the outcomes of the design are visible and easily interpreted. A design fails when a user thinks of how they are going to remember anything. </p>
<p><strong>Seven principles for transforming difficult tasks into simple ones</strong></p>
<p>How does a designer go about a task?</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Using world knowledge and the knowledge in the head.</li>
<li>Simplifying the structure of the tasks.</li>
<li>Making things visible: Bridge gulfs of execution and evaluation.</li>
<li>Getting the mappings right.</li>
<li>Exploiting the power of constraints, both natural and artificial.</li>
<li>Designing for error.</li>
<li>When all else fails, standardize.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Using world knowledge and the knowledge in the head</strong></li>
<p>According to W.B.Park people learn better and feel more comfortable when the knowledge required for a task is available externally (explicit in the world or readily derived through constraints). Knowledge is only useful if there is a natural easily interpreted relationship between that knowledge and the information it is intended to convey about possible actions and outcomes. Performance can be faster and efficient if the user can internalize required knowledge into their head and the design should not obstruct action e.g. for users who are well practiced and experienced. It should be easy to combine the knowledge in the head with that in the world, whichever is readily available be used without interference of the other and can support each other. </p>
<p><strong>Three conceptual models</strong></p>
<p>If the user has a conceptual model, the operation of any device is easily learned and problems are tracked down more accurately and easily. For this to happen, it requires the principles of operation be observable, all actions be consistent with the conceptual model and the visible parts of the device reflect the current state of the device with consistency with the model. Designer should develop a conceptual model appropriate for the user that highlights important parts of the operation of the device that is understandable by the user. Three different aspects of mental models must be distinguished:</p>
<p>•	Design model – the conceptualization that the designer has in mind.</p>
<p>•	User’s model – what the user develops to explain the operation of the system</p>
<p>•	System image – it is critical, designer must ensure everything about the product is consistent with and exemplifies the operation of the proper conceptual model.</p>
<p>The user’ model and the design model are equivalent. However, user and designer communicate only through the system itself (the physical appearance, its operation, the way it responds and the manuals and instructions that accompany it). Among the three aspects, the user’s model is essential because it determines what is understood, it is up to the designer to start with a design model that is functional, learnable and useable. Designer must the system reveals the appropriate system image, from this, the user can acquire the proper user’s model and find support for the translation of intentions into actions and system state into interpretations. Note that user acquires all knowledge of the system from that system image.</p>
<p><strong>The role of manuals</strong></p>
<p>System image will include instructions and documentation. Most manuals don’t assist users as they should because of the nature it was written on e.g. they are written hastily after the product is designed. In the best of worlds, manuals are written first before the design and users do a test using mockups of the product. Even after carefully coming up with a manual, many users still don’t read them, designers have to deal with human nature when they design complex systems.</p>
<li><strong>Simplifying the structure of the tasks</strong></li>
<p>Structure of task should be simple, minimizing the planning or problem solving they require. You can restructure complex tasks using technological tasks. The designer must pay attention to the psychology of the person like how much a person can hold in memory at a time. The limitations of the Short Term Memory (STM) are such that a person should not be required to remember more than about five unrelated items at one time, the system should provide technological assistance for any temporary memory requirement. The limitations of long term memory (LTM) mean that information is better and easily acquired if it makes sense, if it can be integrated into some conceptual framework. However, getting information from the LTM can be slow and contain errors. The system should assist by minimizing interruption, by providing aids to allow for recovery of the exact status of the operations that were interrupted. A task can be restructured through technology, or technology might provide aids to reduce the mental load. Technological aids should show the alternative courses of action; help evaluate implications; and portray outcomes in a more complete, more easily interpretable manner. These aids can make the mappings more visible or, better, make the mappings more natural. Four major technological approaches can be followed:</p>
